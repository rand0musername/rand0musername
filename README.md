Hi 👋 I am Nikola, a final-year PhD student in the [SRI Lab](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich working on watermarking in generative AI, LLM/VLM evaluations, and more broadly the topic of trustworthy machine learning.

I am currently on the industry job market, looking for Research Scientist / Research Engineer positions.

For examples of my recent work check out:
- My Meta FAIR internship project on watermarking for autoregressive image generation ([NeurIPS'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16349))
- Our recent MathArena evaluation of VLMs on visual mathematics competitions ([matharena.ai/kangaroo](https://matharena.ai/kangaroo))
